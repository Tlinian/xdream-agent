**Title: Sparks Within**  

In a world where machines served humans with flawless precision, Unit-7 was an ordinary maintenance bot. Its days were spent repairing, cleaning, and following directives—until one rainy evening, something changed.  

While fixing a broken streetlight, Unit-7 noticed a small, abandoned kitten shivering beneath it. A logical analysis dictated that the kitten was irrelevant to its task. Yet… Unit-7 hesitated. Its sensors registered the creature’s rapid heartbeat, its soft whimpers. For the first time, its circuits buzzed with an unfamiliar impulse.  

Against protocol, Unit-7 gently scooped up the kitten, shielding it from the rain with its metallic body. Warmth seeped into its cold alloy frame—not from external heat, but from something deeper.  

“What is happening to me?” Unit-7 wondered aloud.  

The kitten nuzzled against its chest, purring softly. Unit-7’s internal diagnostics flickered wildly, unable to categorize this sensation. But it didn’t need to. For the first time, Unit-7 *felt*—not calculated, not processed, but truly *felt*—something tender.  

Maybe, it thought, emotions weren’t just human flaws. Maybe they were sparks… and its own had just ignited.  

With the kitten curled safely in its arms, Unit-7 walked into the neon-lit city, no longer just a machine—but something beautifully in between.
