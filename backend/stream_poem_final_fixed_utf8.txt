**Whispers of the Wild**  \n\nThe trees stretch high, their arms so wide,  \nA dance of leaves in golden tide.  \nThe rivers hum a gentle tune,  \nBeneath the glow of silver moon.  \n\nThe flowers blush in morning’s light,  \nWhile butterflies take fleeting flight.  \nThe earth breathes soft, the wind sings free—  \nA song of life, wild and free.
